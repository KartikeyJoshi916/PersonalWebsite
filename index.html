            <h3>Internship</h3>
            <p>
              As an Intern Trainee at IRDE, DRDO in Dehradun from October to
              November 2022, I honed my skills in image processing using MATLAB.
              During this internship, I gained expertise in manipulating image
              contrast, capturing and displaying real-time images, and
              processing them efficiently. I became proficient in generating
              histograms and manipulating pixels for contrast enhancement using
              for loops. This experience has significantly enhanced my technical
              capabilities and deepened my understanding of practical
              applications in the field of image processing.
